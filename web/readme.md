## WEB Applications

This is the place for your web apps. The routing on port `:80` should point to this folder, and all its contents must be exposed to external `HTTP(s)` requests.

You can place a single application directly here, which will be available at `http(s)://{host}/` or use any directory structure that allows access to several applications at the same time.
